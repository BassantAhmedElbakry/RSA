# RSA
## RSA Encryption in Python
This repository contains Python code for implementing the RSA encryption algorithm. RSA is a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure communication.

## Functionality
The code performs the following:

Generates prime numbers
Creates an RSA key pair (public and private keys)
Encrypts messages using the public key
Decrypts messages using the private key
Performs self-tests to validate encryption and decryption functionality

## Understanding the Code
The code includes comments explaining each step of the RSA algorithm. Key functions include:

is_prime(num): Checks if a number is prime
</br>generate_random_prime(lower, upper): Generates a random prime number within a range
</br>(p, q, n, phi_n, e, d): Key generation functions
</br>(C, Decryption_M): Encryption and decryption functions
Dependencies
</br>This code uses the built-in Python libraries random and math.
